                <p>I’m <strong>Sarah Almukhtar</strong>, a digital designer formerly at <strong>The New York Times</strong>. My work there taught me so much about how to design for the user, prioritize visuals, and tell an engaging story. You can find some of my project highlights below. Here are my <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/sarah-almukhtar" target="_blank">bylines</a> and <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v6RBMzjOvUDMMmEfhPvJg58Y0jVJy6dzxjdWfqGO6F0/edit?usp=sharing"  target="_blank">resume</a> for the rest!</p>

My goal was to push it to become a more visual and useful digital tool for readers. I prototyped several designs, including ones that would totally depart from the original structure. But this was a lesson in compromise that led to a design that prioritizes photography, short lists, and navigation but works with the skills and desires of the travel team. I also helped train the editors in the new production process that allowed them to publish the column weekly.</span>

I interviewed my coworkers to add their voices to the piece and convinced my editor that we should include some of our beautiful designs that were printed in the newspaper. The result was a much more dynamic interactive than we had done in the past.</span></div>

We decided to try to do that immediately with the top of the piece, so that was a major design focus for me. As the user scrolls, the dots become denser and impossible to count, just as the loss is difficult to wrap one’s mind around. The design also needed to support the graphics, so I structured the piece by using layers that take the reader in and out of the visualizations.</span></div>

We learned a lot about communication as we tried to follow up with responders for more detail and photos.
